Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to express my keen interest in participating in the "Methods for Data Analysis" course, a part of the Data Science Professional Certificate program. The course aligns with my professional experience and goals and will allow me to advance my software engineering career. For the past eight years, I have worked as a programmer in major corporations in the Puget Sound region in teams with different technical scopes. I wish to gain expertise in topics related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

Being a part of the Business Integrity team at Facebook exposed me to applications of Machine Learning from an application engineer perspective. I designed and implemented pipelines that extract features from video files and feed them into Machine Learning models to identify malicious actors on Facebook and Instagram. This experience sparked my interest in Machine Learning â€“ it encouraged me to complete the online Deep Learning specialization offered by deeplearning.ai and the Machine Learning course offered by Stanford University.

As a BA in Statistics and Econometrics, I have a fundamental knowledge of data analysis. After being let go from Google, Inc. during the mass layoff on January 20, 2023, I decided to focus on becoming proficient in data solutions. On April 3, I'm starting a job at preemo.io, a startup aiming to simplify training models. With the "Methods in Data Analysis" course, I hope to achieve the expertise and the foundations for further education in Data Science.

Sincerely,
Mateusz Haligowski
