Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to you to express my keen interest in participation in the course "Methods for Data Analysis", a part of the Data Science Professional Certificate program. The course aligns with my professional experience and goals, and will allow me to further my career of software engineer. I expect to gain expertise in topics related to Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

For the past 8 years I have been working as a software engineer in the major companies in Puget Sound region in teams with different technical scope. Being a part of the Business Integrity team at Facebook exposed me to applications of Machine Learning from an application engineer perspective. I designed and implemented pipelines extracting features from video files and feeding them into Machine Learning models to identify malicious actors on Facebook and Instagram. This experience sparked my interest and encouraged me to complete online the Deep Learning specialization offered by deeplearning.ai and Machine Learning course offered by the Stanford University.

After being let go from Google, Inc. during the mass layoff on January 20, 2023 I decided that the time is right to focus on becoming a software engineer proficient in data solutions. As a BA in Statistics and Econometrics from the University of Gdańsk, Poland, I have a basic knowledge of data analysis. With the „Methods in Data Analysis” course I hope to achieve the expertise and the foundations for further education in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Sincerely,
Mateusz Haligowski
