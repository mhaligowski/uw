    "# Multiclass Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "While binary classifiers are used to distinguish between two classes (e.g. detect if a transaction is a fraudulent one, classify an email into either spam or non-spam and etc.), multiclass classifiers distinguish between more than two classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways that we can use to perform multiclass classification by leveraging any binary classifiers. In this exercise, you will implement two such strategies for multiclass classification: _One-versus-all_ strategy and _One-versus-one_ strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-versus-all (OvA)**: In this strategy, we train a single binary classifier per class, with the samples of that class as positive samples and all other samples as negatives. During inference, we get the prediction from each classifier and select the class with the highest score. This strategy is also called the one-versus-the-rest strtegey. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-versus-one (OvO)**: In this strategy, we train a binary classifier for every pair of classes. If there are N classes in the problem, you need to train N * (N-1) / 2 classifiers. During inference, we have to run through all N * (N-1) / 2 classifiers and ses which class wins the most votes. The main advantage of OvO strategy is that each binary classifier only needs to be train on the part of the training dataset for the two classes that it needs to separate. "
