Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to express my keen interest in participating in the course "Methods for Data Analysis", a part of the Data Science Professional Certificate program. The course aligns with my professional experience and goals and will allow me to further my software engineering career. I expect to gain expertise in topics related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

For the past eight years, I have worked as a software engineer in major corporations in the Puget Sound region in teams with different technical scopes. Being a part of the Business Integrity team at Facebook exposed me to applications of Machine Learning from an application engineer perspective. I designed and implemented pipelines, extracting features from video files and feeding them into Machine Learning models to identify malicious actors on Facebook and Instagram. 
This experience sparked my interest in machine learning â€“ it encouraged me to complete the online Deep Learning specialization offered by deeplearning.ai and the Machine Learning course offered by Stanford University.

After being let go from Google, Inc. during the mass layoff on January 20, 2023, I decided that it was time to focus on becoming a software engineer specifically proficient in data solutions. As a graduate of the University of Gdansk, Poland, with a BA in Statistics and Econometrics, I have a basic knowledge of data analysis. With the "Methods in Data Analysis" course, I hope to achieve the expertise and the foundations for further education in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Sincerely,
Mateusz Haligowski
